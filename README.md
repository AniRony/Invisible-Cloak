# Computer Vision Project
## Invisible-Cloak
- It is a Computer Vision Project of Real Time Masking of any Color. I tried with Red Color, Blue color and Green Color Clothes. It worked perfectly.
- For Red Color one has to notice the two arrays of colors as we are defining the color in HSV space whose H-[0-180], S-[0-255], V[0-255]. Red's value ranges from 0-10 in the beginning and 160-180 at the end. So you have to decide the H value from the Plot shown in the python file.
- Just a point to remember: This CV2 codes runs better on your local system. You may try to run on virtual machines like Colab. It's possible but you have to use Java Script for that. So not at all suggested.
- Run it freely on Jupyter Notebook.

## Red Rose or Any Particular Color Detection
- Also a small piece of code is attached to show how the same package works for images too.
- We have detected and separated out our only matter of concern that is red rose from all of the boundaries. It's like a Color Pop Filter effect.
- Instead of Red Rose you can apply the same for green plants and green objects.
- You can also apply the same theory to detect the red colored sign board and abstract it in either black and white as masked image or as a Red Colored  image.
- Then as another project we can add detect the handwriting from the traffic sign image and thus act accordingly for a automated car.
